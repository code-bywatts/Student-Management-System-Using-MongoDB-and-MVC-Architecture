# Student Management System using MongoDB/MVC-Architecture by VASU WATTS
Developed a structured backend application utilizing Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB with Mongoose, following the principles of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The project manages student information through well-defined models, controllers, and routes, ensuring clear separation of concerns and scalability. A Student model was implemented with essential fields such as name, age, and course, while the controller encapsulates the logic for CRUD operationsâ€”creating, reading, updating, and deleting student records. Routes are organized to efficiently connect client requests with corresponding controller actions. The project demonstrates a clean, modular approach to backend development, emphasizing maintainability, reusability, and structured database interaction.
